    <h1>Autumn</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>autumn, season of the year between summer and winter during 
        which temperatures gradually decrease. It is often called fall 
        in the United States because leaves fall from the trees at 
        that time. Autumn is usually defined in the Northern 
        Hemisphere as the period between the autumnal equinox (day and 
        night equal in length), September 22 or 23, and the winter 
        solstice (year’s shortest day), December 21 or 22; and in the 
        Southern Hemisphere as the period between March 20 or 21 and 
        June 21 or 22. The autumn temperature transition between 
        summer heat and winter cold occurs only in middle and high 
        latitudes; in equatorial regions, temperatures generally vary 
        little during the year. In the polar regions autumn is very 
        short. For physical causes of the seasons, see season.The 
        concept of autumn in European languages is connected with the 
        harvesting of crops; in many cultures autumn, like the other 
        seasons, has been marked by rites and festivals revolving 
        around the season’s importance in food production. Animals 
        gather food in autumn in preparation for the coming winter, 
        and those with fur often grow thicker coats. Many birds 
        migrate toward the Equator to escape the falling temperatures. 
        A common autumn phenomenon in the central and eastern United 
        States and in Europe is Indian summer, a period of 
        unseasonably warm weather that sometimes occurs in late 
        October or November.
