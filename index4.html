    <h1>September</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>September is the ninth month of the year in both the Julian and 
        Gregorian calendars, the third of four months to have a length 
        of 30 days, and the fourth of five months to have a length of 
        fewer than 31 days. September in the Northern Hemisphere and 
        March in the Southern Hemisphere are seasonally equivalent.In 
        the Northern hemisphere, the beginning of the meteorological 
        autumn is on 1 September. In the Southern hemisphere, the 
        beginning of the meteorological spring is on 1 September.
        September marks the beginning of the ecclesiastical year in 
        the Eastern Orthodox Church. It is the start of the academic 
        year in many countries of the northern hemisphere, in which 
        children go back to school after the summer break, sometimes 
        on the first day of the month.September (from Latin septem, 
        "seven") was originally the seventh of ten months in the 
        oldest known Roman calendar, the calendar of Romulus c. 750 
        BC, with March (Latin Martius) the first month of the year 
        until perhaps as late as 451 BC.After the calendar reform that 
        added January and February to the beginning of the year, 
        September became the ninth month but retained its name. It 
        had 29 days until the Julian reform, which added a day.

        <h1>October</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>October is the tenth month of the year in the Julian and 
            Gregorian calendars and the sixth of seven months to have 
            a length of 31 days. The eighth month in the old calendar 
            of Romulus c. 750 BC, October retained its name (from 
            Latin and Greek ôctō meaning "eight") after January and 
            February were inserted into the calendar that had 
            originally been created by the Romans. In Ancient Rome, 
            one of three Mundus patet would take place on October 5, 
            Meditrinalia October 11, Augustalia on October 12, October 
            Horse on October 15, and Armilustrium on October 19. These 
            dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. 
            Among the Anglo-Saxons, it was known as Winterfylleth 
            (Ƿinterfylleþ), because at this full moon, winter was 
            supposed to begin.October is commonly associated with the 
            season of spring in parts of the Southern Hemisphere, and 
            autumn in parts of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is 
            the seasonal equivalent to April in the Southern 
            Hemisphere and vice versa.

            <h1>November</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>November is the eleventh and penultimate month of the 
                year in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars, the fourth 
                and last of four months to have a length of 30 days 
                and the fifth and last of five months to have a length 
                of fewer than 31 days. November was the ninth month of 
                the calendar of Romulus c. 750 BC. November retained 
                its name (from the Latin novem meaning "nine") when 
                January and February were added to the Roman calendar. 
                November is a month of late spring in the Southern 
                Hemisphere and late autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. 
                Therefore, November in the Southern Hemisphere is the 
                seasonal equivalent of May in the Northern Hemisphere 
                and vice versa. In Ancient Rome, Ludi Plebeii was held 
                from November 4–17, Epulum Jovis was held on November 
                13 and Brumalia celebrations began on November 24. 
                These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian 
                calendar.November was referred to as Blōtmōnaþ by the 
                Anglo-Saxons. Brumaire and Frimaire were the months on 
                which November fell in the French Republican calendar.
