        <h1>The History and Science of Autumn</h1>
        <hr><br>
        <p>Autumn is here! The leaves are losing their chlorophyll,  
            animals are getting fat for winter, and children are 
            looking forward to the end of the month when it’s 
            culturally acceptable to stuff their faces with candy. It 
            is a time of transition, tradition and festive fun. There 
            is so much history and biology to the season of Autumn and 
            that is exactly what this post will be about. If you have 
            ever been curious how different animals have adapted to 
            survive the winter or wondered why we avoid black cats 
            around Halloween, this post will tell you!Autumn is a time 
            of change. It is a time of the harvest and plenty. In fact 
            prior to the 14th century, the season was just known as 
            “harvest” or was not recognized at all as most cultures 
            around the world only recognized summer and winter. It 
            wasn’t until the 17th century that the term “Fall” came 
            into use, now primarily in the United States and is 
            believed to have been named to poetically complement it’s 
            opposite season, Spring.We owe our seasons to the tilt of 
            Earth’s axis. That 23.5 degree tilt allows one hemisphere 
            to be angled towards the sun (summer) and the other to be 
            angled away (winter). The times between these direct tilts 
            are our transition seasons, Spring and Autumn/ Fall. These 
            times are also called Equinoxes and are when the times of 
            night and day are nearly equal. In fact the word Equinox 
            comes from the Latin words Aequus meaning “equal” and Nox 
            meaning “night”. 
        </p>

        <p>The lack of sunlight and temperature drop experienced in 
            Autumn are the reasons behind the beautiful foliage that 
            the north east is known for. It is actually a survival 
            technique that the trees had developed to prepare 
            themselves for winter to survive. In the spring and 
            summer, when it is warm and there is lots of sunlight, 
            plants produce chlorophyll. This chemical is used to split 
            water molecules within the plant into Hydrogen and Oxygen 
            atoms to make glucose for the plant. It is also what gives 
            plants their green color. Chlorophyll is sensitive to cold 
            so when Autumn comes around trees stop producing 
            chlorophyll to save energy and so they lose their green 
            color. The colors that we see in Autumn are actually 
            caused by pigments found underneath the chlorophyll. Trees 
            that turn yellow or orange such as birches, beech and some 
            oaks have carotenoids, the same pigment that gives carrots 
            their color. Reds and purples of other trees such as red 
            maples come from anthocyanins, a pigment also found in 
            apples and strawberries.

        <p>Plants aren’t the only ones adapted to survive the dropping 
            temperatures. Animals that live in places like New 
            Hampshire that experience these changes have to be adapted 
            to survive.  Autumn is a time of preparing for the coming 
            winter and that can be done in a variety of ways. Some 
            animals like birds, some bats, whales and insects will 
            migrate to warmer places where food may be more abundant.
            Migration is often referred to as “going south” for the 
            winter but it can actually be a movement south, east, west 
            or even just a change in elevation. Some animals migrate 
            incredible distances. The Arctic Tern spends its summers 
            at the North pole and migrates all the way down to 
            Antarctica for the winter and back again every year. In 
            the North East our monarch butterflies spend summers here 
            and in Canada and will migrate down to Mexico for the 
            winter.Animals that don’t have the ability to leave to 
            avoid the colder temperatures have developed a variety of 
            ways to survive the winter. Bears are commonly believed to 
            hibernate but they actually do what is called denning. 
            Denning differs from hibernation in that it is only a 
            light form of dormancy and animals that den can wake up 
            during the winter. When denning, a bear’s body temperature 
            will not drop as low as a true hibernators but it will 
            lose significantly more body weight. This means bears have 
            to put on much extra fat during the fall in order to 
            survive the winter. Because it is a lighter form of 
            dormancy bears can wake up during the winter, however this 
            can decrease their chances of survival. Female black bears 
            will give birth and suckle their young while denning. True 
            hibernators include animals like chipmunks, mice, reptiles 
            and amphibians. These animals experience a large drop in 
            body temperature and are asleep for the whole winter. They 
            also need to build up a layer of fat in order to survive.
            Some animals that don’t migrate, hibernate or den for the
            winter have developed physical or behavioral adaptations 
            for winter. Animals such as gray foxes change their diets 
            to what food is available for the season. Gray foxes are 
            omnivorous, eating both plant and animal matter. In the 
            summer and fall when vegetation, nuts, and berries are 
            plentiful, that is what they will feed on. When those food 
            sources are gone in winter, they will switch to eating 
            meat such as small mammals and birds. This behavioral 
            adaptation allows the fox a wider variety of food sources 
            and so is more likely to survive.

        <p>The snow-shoe hare and short-tailed weasel are two New 
            Hampshire residents with mirrored physical adaptations for 
            winter. They have the relationship of predator (weasel) 
            and prey (hare). In the summer, both sport a brown (in the 
            case of the weasel, brown and white) fur coat. Both are 
            used for camouflage with the hare attempting to hide from
            predators and the weasel attempting to blend in to better 
            hunt its prey. In the winter, both species grow new white 
            coats for the same purposes.

        <p>While Autumn is the time to prepare for the coming winter 
            for animals, for us humans it is a time for celebrating. 
            Various cultures around the world have holidays and 
            festivals in Autumn. “Autumn, or fall, is rich with 
            different festivals which mainly celebrate the return of 
            light, harvest, and, like spring, rebirth through death. 
            Harvest celebrations tend to combine giving thanks with 
            prayers for future abundance, to propitiate the god(s) and 
            ensure successful crops” (Cristina De Rossi, an 
            anthropologist at Barnet and Southgate College in London). 
            In Mexico on November 2, Dia de los Muertos (The day of 
            the dead) is celebrated with parties, flowers, and 
            traditional food to honor the dead. The day before, on 
            November 1, Catholics celebrate All Saints Day  by 
            bringing flowers to the graves of loved ones. And of 
            course on the last day of October in the United States, 
            Halloween is celebrated with costumes, bobbing for apples 
            and trick-or-treat. Halloween has been celebrated in the 
            US since the time of the colonies and previously by the 
            Celts 2,000 years ago. The holiday has changed much over 
            the millennia and some of of the Halloween activities 
            celebrated 2,000 years ago are still enjoyed today.

              </a>Halloween first began as the holiday of Samhain, which the 
              Celts celebrated as the beginning of the new year on 
              November 1. This day marked the end of summer and the 
            beginning of winter. This day was also associated with death since winter was 
            a dark and cold time that some did not survive. On this day, the Celts 
            believed that the boundary between our world and the spirit world became 
            blurred and that spirits could return. Spirits were blamed for bad crops and 
            other mysterious happenstances around this time but the Celts also believed 
            this was a time when their priests, known as Druids, could make important 
            prophecies for the coming year. These prophecies could be ill omens of sources
            of comfort during the long cold winter. Activities to celebrate Samhain 
            included building huge sacred bonfires, dressing in costumes made of animal 
            skins and telling fortunes.When to Romans conquered Celtic lands in 43 A.D. 
            traditional Roman festivals combined with Samhain. The Romans also celebrated 
            a day late in October to honor the dead and the goddess of fruit and trees, 
            Pomona. Pomona’s symbol was the apple and it is believed that our tradition of 
            bobbing for apples on Halloween came from the combining of this Roman holiday 
            with Samhain. In 1000 A.D. after Christianity had moved to Celtic lands the 
            Catholic church named November 2 All-Souls Day. Similar to Samhain, this day 
            was celebrated with parties, bonfires and people wearing costumes of angels 
            and devils. All-Souls Day was also called All-Hallows or All-Hallowsmas. The 
            day before, the traditional day of Samhain to the Celts, became later known as 
            All-Hallows eve and eventually Halloween.

        <p>Later Halloween came to Colonial America but was very limited in it’s 
            celebrations due to strong Protestant beliefs. When it arrived the beliefs of 
            various European cultures and that of the Native Americans mixed into what is 
            similar to the Halloween we celebrate today. One of the first traditions were 
            known as “play-parties” which were large public gatherings where people would 
            sing, dance, tell ghost stories and read fortunes. Festivals at this time of 
            year were common by the mid 19th century but it wasn’t until a few decades 
            later when Irish fleeing from the potato famine came to America and 
            popularized Halloween all over the country. 
        </p>
        <hr><br>
        <p>In the late 1800’s people wanted Halloween to be a more family oriented and 
            child friendly event. So instead of parties focused on witchcraft and spirits, 
            people would have large community parties where families would play games, eat 
            seasonal food, and dress in costume. By the 1950’s Halloween had become mainly 
            focused around children mainly due to the 50’s baby boom. Celebrations moved 
            from town centers to classrooms and at home. The tradition of Trick-or-treat 
            arose from when adults would give out treats to neighborhood children so as 
            not to be pranked.Halloween is a time of superstition and magic. It’s when we 
            are especially careful to avoid sources of bad luck. The story of black cats 
            becoming a part of Halloween comes from the middle ages. It was believed that 
            to avoid capture, witches would transform themselves in black cats and bring 
            bad luck to those who crossed their path. Salt was believed to keep away bad 
            spirits and spilling salt was deemed unlucky.There is certainly a magic to the 
            season of Autumn, whether or not you believe in witches and ghosts. A time 
            when the very trees prepare to sleep and the breeze bears the birds to fairer
            skies. It is certainly one of my favorite times of year to spend with family 
            and friends picking apples, carving pumpkins and enjoying the foliage. However 
            you celebrate the season, Happy Fall!
